# AHA-GUI
The GUI portion of the AHA project which visualizes results from the AHA-Scraper developed by ESIC, Washington State University.



NOTE:
This project uses GraphStream. For now the dependencies are located within this repo for ease of initial colaboration/testing with other researchers, eventually this will be done automatically by the build script on first build and they will be removed from the repo, but since the graphstream site does not have HTTPS enabled right now, this is the easiest way to ensure people can get the deps easily and safely.
